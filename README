This is a rewrite of the class found at http://www.phpclasses.org/package/2351-PHP-Access-IMAP-mailboxes-without-PHP-IMAP-extension.html as I found it lacking in some asspects and over reaching in otheres.

The class still acts in a command respond fashion instead of per line evaluation, witch is a violation of the IMAP specefication.
Currently it is lacking processessing for fetch responces
